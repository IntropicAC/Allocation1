Hello welcome to my allocation app!

Still in early development. The purpose of this app is to stream line the process for nurses to asssign jobs or "obserations" to staff within
the ward I work on. 

This is hosted and can be used at: https://allocation-amber.vercel.app/

How to use:

Start by adding "patients" and there the corresponding "observation" they are on. Whether 2 staff "2:1" or 3 staff "3:1". As well as "Generals" which is a check off all patients within the hour, (May be confusing if you dot work in the field). Once youve added patients press "next". 

On the staff page add "staff members" their "breaks", whether they are "security" for that day or not, the observation they were on in the fisrt hour of the shift, (must be assigned before continuing). Then "next".

On the allocation page you can then click "assign staff". This will fill the day automatically with what jobs each staff member is assigned for in each hour. This accounts for breaks and evenly distributes staff jobs making sure to not give them the same jobs threw out the day and spreading jobs out evenly. 

You can then print or reset the page at the click of a button. As well as go back to make any changes to staff or patients.

Enjoy!.
